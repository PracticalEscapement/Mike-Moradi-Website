          Becoming a great problem solver is arguably the greatest achievement possible. Getting to that level is no easy task, as it takes countless hours of hard work and determination. 
          Growing up I was able to start this learning process while working for my father as a watchmaker. A disassembled mechanical watch can be scary to look at, just like code written from previous projects ;). 
          But after enough hours of frustration the watch is brought back to life. Programming is also a trade that relys on continuous learning and improvment.

          My journey to become a software developer felt the same as when I became a watchmaker. 
          The more I practiced, the better I became, and the better I wanted to become. I have always been a problem solver, and I take pride in building great software.
          My main goal is to land a job as a back end developer however, I also enjoy working with React. I'm currently learning to build API's with FastAPI and graphql. 
          To prepare for interviews data structures and leetcode problems have been my only friends as of recently. 

          Im familiar with front end, back end, and other technologies, such as...
          -React
          -Ruby on Rails
          -Rspec
          -Python
          -Object oriented programming
          -Javascript
          -Ruby
          -Git
          -Html
          -CSS
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
