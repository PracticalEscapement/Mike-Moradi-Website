          Becoming a great problem solver is arguably the greatest achievement possible. Getting to that level is no easy task, as it takes countless hours of hard work and determination. 
          Growing up I was able to start this learning process while working for my father as a watchmaker. If you have ever seen a mechanical watch disassembled, 
          it's very overwhelming to observe the number of components laid out in front of you. 
          After enough hours of frustration the watch is brought back to life. At that moment a level of pride never felt before hits you, and you're hooked. 

          My journey to become a software developer felt the same as when I became a watchmaker. 
          The more I practiced, the better I became, and the better I wanted to become. I have always been a problem solver, and I take pride in building great software.
